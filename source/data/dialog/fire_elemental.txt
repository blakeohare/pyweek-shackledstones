Brave Ones! That was a good fight you put up to get
here. Light is right to call you the new Order of
Haskell.

Thank you, Fire Spirit. I hope they have not tired
you so much.

Hah! Mortals can never extract enough power from me.
Don't you worry.

I see... so that's how it is.

Meyer?!

That diversion didn't quite work, %NAME%.

Spirits of the earth as power sources. I knew that the
Supreme Nation suddenly cropping up from nothing is too
good to be true.

%NAME%, I suppose you have the Life Temple next. It's
in the Forbidden Forest in the southwest.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
How did you know?
[pause]

[profile][meyer]
I told you, I'm always after you. You and your Order
now, that is.
[pause]

[profile][meyer]
Now get out. I'm going to blow up this place.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
Wha... why? They'll have your head!
[pause]

[profile][meyer]
With you getting this far, they're already going to.
Now get out. You didn't see me.
[pause]

[profile][fire_spirit]
Hah! A government lackey with a backbone! Meyer, is
it? Do your best. I'll watch over you.
[pause]

[profile][meyer]
It is my honor, Fire Spirit.

Go, %NAME%. Southwest. We'll meet again.
