Ah, brave ones. I must thank you. It has been far too
long.

[profile][mc_portrait]
How long have they been holding you?

[profile][water_spirit]
Sixty long years, brave ones. A most unpleasant
containment, being thrown around like cattle.

[profile][mc_portrait]
What were they doing with you?

[profile][water_spirit]
Your lords have been harnessing our power. Even now,
part of me lives in your vessel on the surface.

Wait... the steam engines run on your power? The entire
nation's? Even mine?
[pause]

[profile][water_spirit]
I sense them through your land. Mere mortals cannot fathom
harnessing more than a hair of my power. Your people are
ahead of your time.

Hmm... most troubling...
[pause]

You must go. They are coming. Worry not. I shall lie in
the ocean for a while. Let me deliver the rain that your
land has long thirsted for.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
I see.

May my brother Light benefit from your assistance? He is
at His temple, shackled and weary.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
I shall, spirit.
[pause]

[profile][water_spirit]
And little one...
[pause]

[profile][maple]
M-me?
[pause]

[profile][water_spirit]
Let me carry your ship onwards. Yours shall be a vessel of
glory.
[pause]

[profile][maple]
...yes!
[pause]

[profile][water_spirit]
Very well, off you go then, brave ones.
