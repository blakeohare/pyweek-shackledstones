Did you find out anything?

Yeah, called in almost all the favors I have in this
place.

The main research facility is located in the west end
of the capital. It looks relatively unguarded in the
outside, but they have automatons guarding inside.

Ah, the automatons. Nothing like a new invention to
make us mercenaries obsolete.

[profile][pierce]
Useless contraptions, though, if you know what you're
doing.

[profile][mc_portrait]
Aim for the head, right?
[pause]

[profile][pierce]
It's that simple.

[profile][mc_portrait]
Thanks, Pierce. Now, let's go.

West end of the capital. Act normal, don't look at
anyone on your way in. I'll find a good getaway
route.
