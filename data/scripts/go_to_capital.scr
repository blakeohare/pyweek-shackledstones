So how do we return the other stones?

We'll have to take it from the capital.

Are you serious?

The government's been holding them there for research
for the past few years. There's no way around it.

...alright. I guess we don't really have a choice.
Pierce, can you find us a way into their facilities?
[pause]

I'll move ahead and see what I can do. We don't have
that many assets left after breaking you out. I guess
a ton of people owe me favors there...

Thanks, Pierce.

The capital is a bit to the south west. I can fly us
there-

No, no, Maple. You stay here. They'll recognize our
ship. We'll have to stay hidden.

Kid, can you make sure it's hard to find while we're
out? We won't be long.

Roger! Be careful!

[profile][mc_portrait]
Alright, let's move!
