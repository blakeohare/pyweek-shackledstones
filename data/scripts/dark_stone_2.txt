Hanlon...

You have all been quite impressive.  Entrusting
you to this great mission was a just decision.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
You're the dark spirit?
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
Aye, it is I.  This old man's body is becoming a
nuisance.  I fear every day of becoming a wayward
spirit if it expires.  I remember when he came to
me as a young heartbroken soul.
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
By that time, water, Fire, and Light had become
silent, and I grew worried.  He accepted my company
with a smile.
[pause]

...

He and I became a most capable musketeer.  We waited
long enough to pu ta ball between the Eternal
Commander's eyes.
[pause]

[profile][pierce]
You assassinated the Supreme Commander's father!?
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
If only that did a thing.  His son knew better.  He
took my stone, leaving me in this body.  I'm sorry.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
For what?
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
For imposing such a great responsibility on your
shoulders.  We spirits have deigned to seek nothing
from mortals, though fire always found it amusing
that water would get rivers of blood sent to her.  Haha...
[pause]

[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
Well, old man, where to next?
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
!
[pause]

[profile][pierce]
Yeah, quit sitting there now, we need a place to go!
[pause]

[profile][maple]
Tell me where to steer, Hanlon!
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
...youngsters have no patience for things.  Fire is
stuck feeding the dogs in Mesembria in the Southern
Mountains.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
Mesembria Power Plant!?
[pause]

[profile][maple]
That's... the biggest power plant in the country!
[pause]

[profile][pierce]
What else has the government been hiding from us!?
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
Everything, boy.  Now go.  Water and Light and I
need to talk.
[pause]

[profile][mc_portrait]
Southern Mountains, right! I'll see you later,
Hanlon!
[pause]

[profile][hanlon]
Stay sharp, Order of Haskell, and thank you.
