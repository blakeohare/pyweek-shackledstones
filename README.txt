
          
We all worked very hard to make this happen and hope you enjoy it!  When
you're done playing we'd love to hear how you liked it!

Yay PyWeek!

The Quick Version:
 Our take on "Caught":
  The story opens with Lapis, a master thief, having been finally caught by her
  arch nemesis.  As the story unfolds we discover that Lapis isn't the only one
  being held against her will...

 Controls:
  Your best bet will be to plug in a gamepad and set it up in the Menu
    - There have been reports that the config is kind of touchy so try hitting
      the gamepad button quickly

  If you're using the Keyboard:
    We call the buttons "A", "B", "X", and "Y" (SNES style) in the game, these
    map to A Space S and D

    Use the arrow keys to move around

    QWERTY:
        - A, <Space> progress through dialogs
        - A, S, and <Space> progress through menus
    DVORAK: 
        - A, <Space> progress through dialogs
        - A, O, and <Space> progress through menus
        - it works this way on windows, don't have any non-qwerty folks 
          to test on other platfoms, sorry!

  <Enter> will access the Inventory during gameplay
  
  While in the Inventory select an item and press ABXY to equip it to that
  button
